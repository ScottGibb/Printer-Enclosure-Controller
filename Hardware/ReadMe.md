# Printer Enclosure Hardware

## Summary

This repository contains the electronic drawings for the printer enclosure subsystem. The subsystem is a very simple schematic in which an LM2596 Breakout board is used alongside an MOSFET to provide USB power and fan control. For this project, due to its simplicity, Fritzing was used to develop the schematics as it gave nice stripboard layouts that can help people get started easier.

## Schematic

The schematic of the hardware is as follows:

## Stripboard

As for the stripboard, the CAD render can be seen below:

## Bill Of Materials

Fritzing also generates a Bill of Materials in htmml, which can be loaded using the following link:

## CAD Model

As for containing this hardware a simple 3D printed case was designed using Fusion 360 and can be seen below:

## Result

This resulted in the following being made:
